# Twilio Programmable Video for iOS

This repository contains releases of Twilio's Programmable Video SDK for iOS. These releases can be consumed using Swift Package Manager, CocoaPods or manual integration into your project.

### Swift Package Manager

You can add Programmable Video for iOS by adding the `https://github.com/twilio/twilio-video-ios` repository as a Swift Package.

In your Build Settings, you will also need to modify `Other Linker Flags` to include `-ObjC.`

As of the latest release of Xcode (currently 12.3), there is a [known issue](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-13343) with consuming binary frameworks distributed via Swift Package Manager. The current workaround to this issue is to add a `Run Script Phase` to the `Build Phases` of your Xcode project. This `Run Script Phase` should come **after** the `Embed Frameworks` build phase. This new `Run Script Phase` should contain the following code:

```sh
find "${CODESIGNING_FOLDER_PATH}" -name '*.framework' -print0 | while read -d $'\0' framework
do
    codesign --force --deep --sign "${EXPANDED_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY}" --preserve-metadata=identifier,entitlements --timestamp=none "${framework}"
done

```


### CocoaPods Integration

We support integration using CocoaPods as well. You can add Programmable Video to your project using the following example Podfile:

```
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs'

platform :ios, '9.0'

target 'TARGET_NAME' do
    pod 'TwilioVideo', '~> 4.6'
end
```

Then run `pod install` to install the dependencies for your project.


### Manual Integration

See [manual installation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/video/ios#add-the-sdk) steps.


### Carthage Integration

Carthage is not currently a supported distribution mechanism for Twilio Video. Carthage does not currently work with `.xcframeworks` as documented [here](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/issues/2890). Once Carthage supports binary `.xcframeworks`, Carthage distribution will be re-added.
